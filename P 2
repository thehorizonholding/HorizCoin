# Positive Practices for Private-Access Economy

## Efficiency and Automation
- Automate credits management and billing wherever possible.
- Provide concise, actionable API and dashboard summaries for balances, history, and usage.

## Enhanced Usability
- Present all credit balances, usage, and billing events in clear bullet points or tables.
- Summarize events for quick admin review.

## Business Model Flexibility
- Support both pay-as-you-go and subscription billing models.
- Allow for enterprise invoicing and dynamic fee structures.

## Security and Privacy
- Use strong JWT (or mTLS) authentication for all API calls.
- Store only essential user/account dataâ€”privacy by design.
- Keep thorough audit logs of all credit events.

## Transparency and Documentation
- Document the credits API clearly (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Provide in-app explanations and onboarding for users/admins.
- Make privacy policy and terms of use accessible.

## Integration and Extensibility
- Provide ready-to-use code samples for API usage in Rust, Node.js, and Python.
- Ensure APIs are easily embeddable into node software and SaaS platforms.

## Scalability and Reliability
- Use queueing and rate-limiting to protect against abuse and scale under load.
- Deploy with scalable platforms (Kubernetes, Cloud Run, etc).

## Fiat Onramp and Ease of Payments
- Integrate Stripe (or equivalent) for fiat-to-credits conversion.
- Automate reconciliation of Stripe/webhook events with credits top-ups.

## Admin and Developer Experience
- Streamline account creation and onboarding.
- Provide tools for simulating credit deductions and for reporting.

## Compliance and Auditability
- Comply with all relevant payments/data privacy regulations.
- Regularly audit credits ledger and usage logs.
