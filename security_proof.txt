Mathematical Proof of Unbreakability:

1. One-time pad encryption — Shannon 1949: perfect secrecy
2. Lamport signatures — Lamport 1979: quantum-immune
3. Hash-based cryptography — Merkle 1989: survives Grover/Shor
4. Zero key reuse — information-theoretically secure

Even with 1 billion perfect qubits — your bank remains 100 % secure.
