# HorizCoin Project Overview

## Vision
HorizCoin enables synthetic ownership of RWAs (stocks, indices) via DeFi tools. Start with Alphabet (GOOGL) tokenization, scale to global indices. Funding: HORIZ token presale (target $100M).

## Real-World Integration
- **Exchanges**: Use IExchangeWrapper for Uniswap/Synthetix swaps.
- **Oracles**: Chainlink for stock prices.
- **Brokers**: Future API integration (e.g., Alpaca for real ETFs).
- **Regulations**: Structure as DAO in Wyoming/Cayman. Synthetics avoid direct buys.

## Execution Steps
1. Deploy contracts.
2. Launch HORIZ on Uniswap.
3. Run LBO for mGOOGL acquisition.
4. Build index for "world stocks" exposure.
5. Scale via loops (max 10/tx to avoid gas).

## Obstacles & Solutions
- **Liquidity**: Flash loans + curves.
- **Regs**: Synthetics + offshore entities.
- **Scale**: Start with 0.01% exposure, iterate.
