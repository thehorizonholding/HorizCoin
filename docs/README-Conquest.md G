# Omega Conquest Treasury – Planetary Tokenized Asset Accumulation

This is the **real, working** core of the project — a decentralized treasury that accumulates **tokenized RWAs** using HORIZ rewards.

## Real-world capabilities (deployable today)
- Swaps HORIZ for any approved ERC-20 RWA token  
- Economic price exposure to Alphabet (GOOGLx/GOOGLON), HSBC (if tokenized), TSMC, NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Broadcom, etc.  
- Runs on Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc. with real Uniswap liquidity  
- Secure, gas-efficient, Ownable + ReentrancyGuard  

## What it does NOT do (non-negotiable boundaries)
- Grant voting rights, board control, or literal ownership  
- Acquire private Class B shares or bypass founder voting power  
- Enable full ownership of Alphabet, HSBC, or global stocks (structurally impossible)  

## Priority Targets (approve these when tokenized & liquid)
- Alphabet (GOOGLx / GOOGLON)  
- HSBC (HSBCx – pending tokenization)  
- TSMC (TSMx)  
- NVIDIA (NVDAx)  
- Apple (AAPLx)  
- Microsoft (MSFTx)  
- Amazon (AMZNx)  
- Broadcom (AVGOx)  
- Treasuries first (OUSG, BUIDL) for yield bootstrapping  

## Deployment & Usage
1. Deploy: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_omega_treasury.js --network mainnet`  
2. Approve RWAs: `approveRWA(0x...GOOGLx)`  
3. Conquer: `conquerRWA(amountHORIZ, targetRWA, minOut)`  

The tokenized mirror is the only real conquest possible. Deploy and accumulate.
