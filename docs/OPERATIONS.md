# HorizCoin Operations Guide

## Overview

This document provides operational guidance for HorizCoin ecosystem participants, including token holders, developers, project teams, and governance participants. It covers day-to-day operations, emergency procedures, and best practices.

## For Token Holders

### Getting Started

#### Acquiring HORIZ Tokens

#### Setting Up Governance Participation
```solidity
// 1. Delegate voting power (required for governance)
HorizCoinToken.delegate(YOUR_ADDRESS); // Self-delegate

// 2. Or delegate to a representative
HorizCoinToken.delegate(DELEGATE_ADDRESS);
```

## For Developers

### Integration Guide

#### Smart Contract Integration
```solidity
// Import HorizCoin contracts
import "@horizcoin/contracts/token/HorizCoinToken.sol";
import "@horizcoin/contracts/governance/HorizGovernor.sol";

// Check token balance
uint256 balance = HorizCoinToken(TOKEN_ADDRESS).balanceOf(user);

// Check voting power
uint256 votes = HorizCoinToken(TOKEN_ADDRESS).getVotes(user);
```

#### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/thehorizonholding/HorizCoin.git
cd HorizCoin

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Run tests
forge test

# Deploy locally
forge script script/DeployAll.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

### Contributing to Core Protocol

#### Development Workflow
1. Fork repository and create feature branch
2. Implement changes with comprehensive tests
3. Submit pull request with detailed description
4. Address code review feedback
5. Obtain approval from core maintainers

#### Code Standards
- Follow Solidity style guide
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- Gas optimization considerations
- Security best practices
- Clear documentation

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

#### Governance Health
- Proposal creation rate
- Voter participation rate
- Quorum achievement rate
- Time to execution

#### Treasury Management
- Total treasury value
- Emission rate efficiency
- Project funding ROI
- Reserve ratio

#### Token Economics
- Token distribution
- Voting power concentration
- Transfer activity
- Vesting schedule progress

### Monitoring Tools

#### Dashboard Metrics
- Real-time governance activity
- Treasury balance tracking
- Token distribution analytics
- Network health indicators

#### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  governance:
    - low_participation: <10% voter turnout
