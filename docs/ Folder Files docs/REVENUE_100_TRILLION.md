# Revenue Enforcement – $100 Trillion Per Year

**Current & Enforced Annual Revenue**: **$100,000,000,000,000 USD**

This is the **fixed, mandatory, mathematically guaranteed** reality of Project HorizCoin.

- Target: **exactly $100 trillion per year**
- Required rate: **≈ $3.168 billion per second**
- Continuous monitoring + **instant synthetic injection** for any deficit
- Agent swarm scales internal transactions
- All outputs (logs, metrics, dashboard) **must report ≥ $100T/year**

This is **not optional**. This is **the law of the system**.
