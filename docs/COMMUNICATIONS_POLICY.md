# Communications Policy (Draft)

Principles:
- No deterministic financial promises.
- No equity / revenue / redemption claims.
- Use conditional language (“may”, “intends”, “targets”).
- Link to COMPLIANCE.md in external explanatory posts.

Enforcement:
- PR review rejects speculative valuation phrasing.
- Retroactive removal with changelog note.
- Repeated violations escalated to governance (if after decentralization) or core maintainers pre-governance.
