# HorizCoin Threat Model

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive threat model for the HorizCoin ecosystem, analyzing potential threats, attack vectors, and defensive measures. The threat model follows a structured approach to identify and address security risks systematically.

## Threat Modeling Methodology

### STRIDE Framework

We use the STRIDE methodology to categorize threats:

- **Spoofing**: Impersonating legitimate users or systems

- **Denial of Service**: Making services unavailable
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized access levels

### Attack Surface Analysis
