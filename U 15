# Tech Stack Additions

This project now includes:
- DevContainer for consistent local dev and GitHub Codespaces.
- Services CI matrix to build all independent services on Rust 1.70.
- CodeQL scanning for Rust.
- SBOM (CycloneDX) generation for supply-chain visibility.
- Dependabot updates for Actions, Cargo, and Docker.
- docker-compose to run all services together locally.
- Makefile and Justfile for common tasks.
- EditorConfig for consistent formatting.

## Local orchestration

```bash
# Build everything (Rust 1.70)
make toolchain build services-build

# Run all services locally
make compose-up

# Tear down
make compose-down
```

## Deployment notes
- Each service has a Dockerfile; you can deploy to Render/Fly/Cloud Run/Lightsail.
- For multi-arch images (arm64 + amd64), enable Docker Buildx and a registry (e.g., GHCR).
- For stronger supply-chain assurances, consider SLSA provenance and signing (cosign).
