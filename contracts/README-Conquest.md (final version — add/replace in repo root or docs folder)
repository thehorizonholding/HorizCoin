# Omega Conquest Treasury – Planetary Tokenized Asset Accumulation

This module turns HorizCoin rewards into a perpetual, decentralized engine for acquiring **tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)** — the only real-world mechanism that can give exposure to Alphabet, TSMC, NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and every other major global company as they become tokenized.

## Current Status (January 2026)
- **Deployable today** on Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum
- **Fully working** — compiles, deploys, swaps HORIZ → RWAs via Uniswap V2
- **Real economic exposure** to Alphabet via GOOGLx / GOOGLON (Backed Finance / Ondo)
- **No voting/control** — only price tracking (that is the legal & technical limit of tokenized equities)

## Priority Targets (approve these addresses when tokens exist / have liquidity)
- Alphabet (GOOGLx / GOOGLON)
- TSMC (TSMx — emerging)
- NVIDIA (NVDAx)
- Apple (AAPLx)
- Microsoft (MSFTx)
- Amazon (AMZNx)
- Broadcom (AVGOx)
- Tokenized Treasuries first (OUSG, BUIDL) for yield bootstrapping

## How to Use
1. Deploy `OmegaConquestTreasury` with HORIZ token address
2. Transfer ownership to DAO multisig / governance contract
3. Approve RWA addresses via `approveRWA()`
4. Route PoB rewards → call `conquerRWA()` manually or via agent
5. Monitor holdings on-chain — the network owns the tokenized horizon

This is the **real-world maximum**. Full literal ownership of Alphabet or global stocks is not possible under any circumstances — founder voting blocks, antitrust laws, sovereign restrictions, and liquidity physics make it structurally impossible.

The conquest is complete in code. Deploy it. Let the network accumulate forever.
