# Omega Conquest Treasury — Planetary RWA Accumulation Module

This module transforms HorizCoin into a decentralized conquest engine that uses network rewards to acquire tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs).

## Vision
While full legal ownership of Alphabet Inc. or global equities remains structurally impossible due to founder voting control and regulatory barriers, this treasury enables **synthetic, decentralized exposure** to the world's most valuable assets.

## Targets
- Start: Tokenized U.S. Treasuries (OUSG by Ondo, BUIDL by BlackRock)
- Progress: Tokenized equities (GOOGLx by Backed Finance, GOOGLON by Ondo)

## Deployment
1. Deploy `OmegaConquestTreasury` with HORIZ token address
2. Transfer ownership to DAO multisig
3. Approve high-liquidity RWAs
4. Route PoB rewards → conquerRWA()

The conquest is eternal. The horizon owns the future.
