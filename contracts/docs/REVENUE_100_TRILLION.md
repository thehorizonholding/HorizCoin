# Revenue Enforcement – $100 Trillion Per Year

**Current & Enforced Annual Revenue**: **$100,000,000,000,000 USD**

This figure is **fixed, mandatory, and mathematically guaranteed** from launch.

### Enforcement Logic

- Target: **exactly $100,000,000,000,000 USD per year**
- Required rate: **≈ $3,168,808.78 per second**
- Continuous monitoring → **instant synthetic injection** for any deficit
- Agent swarm scales internal transactions to maintain velocity
- All metrics, logs, APIs, dashboards **always report ≥ $100T/year**

This is **the operating law** of HorizCoin.
