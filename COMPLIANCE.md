# Compliance & Regulatory (Stub)

This project’s on-chain components DO NOT themselves provide brokerage, custody, or equity issuance. Any integration with regulated financial instruments MUST occur through appropriately licensed third parties.

## Baseline Principles
- HZC is a utility/governance token for protocol coordination; not an equity instrument.
- Brokerage / securities functionality (if any) must: 
  - Be segregated logically and organizationally
  - Involve KYC/AML & sanctions screening through a regulated partner
  - Avoid implying token-equity convertibility without explicit, lawful structure

## Recommended Jurisdictional Exclusions (Illustrative Only)
- OFAC-sanctioned jurisdictions
- Other high-risk regions per internal risk assessment

## Forward-Looking & Valuation Statements
Any references to potential future scale, market size, asset acquisition capability, or comparative economic magnitude are inherently speculative, uncertain, and NOT commitments, promises, or guarantees. No statement in this repository should be interpreted as:
- A guarantee of future token price performance
- An assurance the token will be accepted as payment for equity, securities, or regulated financial instruments
- A promise of acquisition of, merger with, or control over any external company or asset

All forward-looking statements should be treated as exploratory or conceptual and may be materially revised or abandoned without notice.

Users and contributors MUST avoid promotional claims implying the token “will” or “can” purchase large companies or represent enormous guaranteed economic value. Such claims increase regulatory and reputational risk.

## Communications Guidance (Contributor Responsibility)
When describing HorizCoin publicly:
- Emphasize technical utility (bandwidth verification, oracle staking, governance coordination)
- Avoid deterministic financial projections
- Do not imply equity rights, revenue share, or redemption claims
- Include disclaimers where context could be misunderstood

## Future Artifacts (To Add)
- Formal sanctions screening policy
- KYC workflow (if brokerage partner integration proceeds)
- Incident response procedure (security + compliance overlap)

## Disclaimer
Nothing here constitutes legal advice. Obtain professional counsel before launch.
