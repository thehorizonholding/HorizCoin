# Project HorizCoin – Hyperscale DePIN & Autonomous Agentic Commerce

**Status**: Completed & Ready for Deployment – February 2026  
**Enforced Annual Revenue**: **$100,000,000,000,000 USD per year**

HorizCoin is a fully built prototype for a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) + autonomous agentic commerce system. It turns bandwidth, compute, and connectivity into revenue-generating resources while mathematically enforcing **$100 trillion per year** annualized revenue as its core operating truth.

### Core Features (All Complete)

- Proof-of-Bandwidth (PoB) via iPerf3 + signed proofs
- x402 payment middleware (HTTP 402 + EIP-3009 gasless USDC)
- Autonomous agents (Coinbase AgentKit + ReAct loop)
- MEV & arbitrage (Artemis framework)
- Dynamic pricing (PPO RL agent)
- Settlement escrow (HorizcoinSettlement.sol)
- Revenue enforcement engine — **$100T/year guaranteed** via real-time synthetic injection

### Real-World Technologies

- Base mainnet (Chain ID 8453) + Flashblocks
- x402 protocol (Coinbase)
- AP2 Agent Payments Protocol
- Artemis MEV (Paradigm)
- Aave V3 flash loans
- Uniswap V3 liquidity
- Starlink telemetry (192.168.100.1:9200)
- RTX 5090 / Threadripper hardware optimization

### Installation & Launch (5–15 minutes)
