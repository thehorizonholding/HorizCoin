  --body "Adds a privacy-first Bandwidth-to-Value capability:
- services/net-observer: per-machine network usage agent (hashed IDs, cloud detection, interval deltas)
- services/data-monetizer-api: ingest, metrics summary, CSV export, marketplace connector stubs
- Dockerfiles for both services
- Example config under configs/monetizer
- Architecture doc under docs/monetization
- Local compose overlay for quick spin-up
- CI workflow to build both services
- Dedicated GHCR publish workflow for these images (multi-arch, provenance, SBOM, optional Cosign on tags)

Notes: telemetry-only (no payloads), provider-compliant (no proxy/bandwidth resale), self-contained PR."
