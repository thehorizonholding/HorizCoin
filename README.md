# HorizCoin

HorizCoin is a blockchain protocol implementing a Proof-of-Bandwidth consensus mechanism. This repository contains the reference implementation of the HorizCoin node software, wallet, and development tools.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Git

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thehorizonholding/HorizCoin.git
cd HorizCoin

# Set Rust version for project
rustup override set 1.70.0

# Build all components
cargo build --workspace

# Run the node
cargo run -p horizcoin-node

# Run the CLI (see help)
cargo run -p horiz-cli -- --help

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Run on the Web

HorizCoin includes a web demo that can be deployed to various cloud platforms for public access.

#### Live Demo

üåê **[https://horizcoin-web.onrender.com](https://horizcoin-web.onrender.com)** - Live demo automatically deployed from main branch

#### Automated Deployment

The repository includes automated deployment configuration for multiple platforms:

**Render (Recommended)**
- Uses `render.yaml` for configuration
- Automatically deploys from main branch when connected to GitHub
- Free tier available with HTTPS included
- No additional setup required once connected

**Railway**
- Uses `railway.toml` for configuration  
- Requires `RAILWAY_TOKEN` and optionally `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` secrets
- Deploys via GitHub Actions workflow

#### Deploy to Your Own Instance

**Option 1: Render**
1. Fork this repository
2. Connect your GitHub account to [Render](https://render.com)
3. Create a new Web Service from your forked repository
4. Render will automatically use the `render.yaml` configuration
5. Your app will be available at `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

**Option 2: Railway**
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a [Railway](https://railway.app) account
3. Create a new project and connect your GitHub repository
4. Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` to your GitHub repository secrets
5. Push to main branch to trigger deployment

**Option 3: GitHub Codespaces**
1. Create a new Codespace from this repository
2. The included Dockerfile will automatically build and run the web demo
3. Access the live demo at the provided public URL

#### Run Locally with Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t horizcoin-web .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e PORT=3000 horizcoin-web
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to see the web interface.

#### Run Locally with Cargo

```bash
# Start the web server
cargo run -p horizcoin-web

# Or specify a custom port
PORT=8080 cargo run -p horizcoin-web
```

The web interface provides:
- **/** - Project overview with version information
- **/healthz** - Health check endpoint for monitoring

### Running a Local Development Network

```bash
# Start a single-node development network
cargo run --bin horizd -- --dev

# In another terminal, create a wallet and send a transaction
cargo run --bin horiz-cli -- wallet create
cargo run --bin horiz-cli -- wallet fund --amount 1000000
cargo run --bin horiz-cli -- send --to <address> --amount 100
```

### Quick Transaction Example

```bash
# Generate a new address
ADDR=$(cargo run --bin horiz-cli -- wallet address)

# Send funds to the address
cargo run --bin horiz-cli -- send --to $ADDR --amount 1000

# Check balance
cargo run --bin horiz-cli -- balance $ADDR
```

## Architecture Overview

HorizCoin is built as a modular Rust workspace with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- **primitives**: Basic types (Hash, TxId, BlockId), constants, and error handling
- **crypto**: Cryptographic primitives (secp256k1, SHA-256, bech32m addresses)
- **codec**: Canonical serialization with serde and length-prefixing
- **tx**: Transaction structure, verification, and memo handling (128-byte UTF-8 limit)
- **merkle**: Merkle tree implementation with SHA-256 and proof generation
- **block**: Block structure and validation (including timestamp skew limits)
- **state**: UTXO set management with apply/rollback capabilities
- **storage**: RocksDB backend with in-memory fallback for testing

### Network and Consensus

- **consensus**: Pluggable consensus interface with DevConsensus (PoA) for development
- **p2p**: Gossip-based networking with headers-first sync and anti-DoS protection
- **mempool**: Transaction pool with admission rules and propagation

### Applications

- **rpc**: JSON-RPC interface for external applications
- **node (horizd)**: Main node executable with configuration and logging
- **wallet + horiz-cli**: Key management, transaction building, and CLI interface

## Protocol Parameters

- **Hashing**: SHA-256 throughout the system
- **Signatures**: secp256k1 via k256 crate
- **Addresses**: bech32m encoding for forward compatibility and safety
- **Memo Limit**: 128 bytes UTF-8 with proper multi-byte boundary handling
- **Timestamp Future Skew**: +120 seconds tolerance (configurable via `TIMESTAMP_FUTURE_SKEW_SECS`)
- **Consensus**: Pluggable interface (DevConsensus for development, PoB for production)

## Development

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with property-based testing
cargo test --features proptest

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Run with test coverage
cargo llvm-cov --html
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Check documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items
```

### Fuzzing

```bash
# Install cargo-fuzz
cargo install cargo-fuzz

# Run fuzz tests
cargo fuzz run codec_decode
cargo fuzz run tx_verify
```

## Economic Design

HorizCoin targets a novel Proof-of-Bandwidth consensus mechanism designed for long-term sustainability. The economic model aims for $80T total economic activity over 10 years (see [issue #33](https://github.com/thehorizonholding/HorizCoin/issues/33) for detailed analysis). However, the current implementation keeps consensus pluggable and does not couple economic parameters to core hashing or validation logic.
