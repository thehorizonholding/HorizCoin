# Horiz Private AI - Advanced Features Package (Safe Add-on)

## Purpose
This package contains **private, safe, and auditable** advanced AI modules you can add to your Horiz project.
It is designed to be integrated as a contained subdirectory (for example `tools/horiz_private_ai`) so the
core project remains untouched.

**Important:** This package **must only** be used with cloud accounts and infrastructure that you own or are
explicitly authorized to manage. Do NOT attempt to access third-party servers without authorization.

## Contents
- controller.py                 : Main orchestrator entrypoint (private mode)
- privacy_guard.py              : Ensures data sharing and transfers are authorized & auditable
- revenue_optimizer.py         : AI-based optimizer to maximize compute-to-revenue yield
- multi_cloud_sync.py          : Safe multi-cloud sync utilities and connectors (placeholders)
- analytics_engine.py          : Data extraction, aggregation, and reporting
- requirements.txt             : Python dependencies (minimal)
- Dockerfile                   : Container image build example
- .gitignore                   : Files to ignore (secrets, keys)
- deploy_staging.sh            : Script to stage the package into a sandbox branch (helper)
- PR_TEMPLATE.md               : Pull Request template for safe review
- LICENSE                      : MIT License stub

## Integration guidance (safe, non-destructive)
1. Add this folder as a contained subdirectory inside your repo, e.g. `tools/horiz_private_ai`.
2. Create a feature branch; do not merge directly to main.
3. Run unit tests and dry-run the orchestrator in a sandbox account.
4. Ensure secrets are stored in your secret manager (Vault / AWS Secrets Manager) - do NOT commit secrets.
5. Require at least one security review & CI gating before merging to main.

## Quick local run (developer sandbox)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export HORIZ_PRIVATE_MODE=true
python controller.py --mode dry-run
```

## Contact / Notes
This package is a starting point and contains placeholder connectors. Replace placeholders with
production-grade connectors (use cloud SDKs & least-privilege roles) before running in production.
