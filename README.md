HorizCoin
Overview

HorizCoin is a new cryptocurrency project aiming to be a community-driven, decentralized digital currency. It's built on a custom blockchain and appears to be focused on providing a platform for secure and transparent transactions. The project is currently under active development. The core focus seems to be on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, with a strong emphasis on security and scalability.

Key Features (Based on Code)

Custom Blockchain: HorizCoin is not a fork of an existing blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It's built from the ground up, offering greater flexibility but also requiring more development effort.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus: The blockchain utilizes a PoS consensus algorithm, meaning that validators are selected based on the amount of HorizCoin they hold and "stake." This is intended to be more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems.

Transaction System: The project includes a system for creating, signing, and verifying transactions.

Wallet Functionality: Basic wallet functionality is present, allowing users to manage their HorizCoin holdings.

Node Implementation: The repository contains the code for running a HorizCoin node, which participates in the blockchain network.

RPC Interface: A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface is implemented, allowing external applications to interact with the HorizCoin node.

Genesis Block: The project defines a genesis block, the first block in the blockchain.

Basic Smart Contract Capabilities: There are indications of initial work towards smart contract functionality, though this appears to be in a very early stage.

Technologies Used

C++: The core blockchain logic and node implementation are written in C++.

CMake: Used as the build system for the project.

Boost Libraries: The project utilizes several Boost libraries for various functionalities (e.g., networking, serialization).

OpenSSL: Used for cryptographic operations.

Getting Started

These instructions provide a basic guide to building and running HorizCoin. Note: These instructions may require adjustments based on your operating system and development environment.

Prerequisites

C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler with C++11 support (e.g., g++, clang++).

CMake: CMake version 3.10 or higher.

Boost Libraries: Install the Boost libraries (version 1.60 or higher). The specific libraries required include:

Boost.System

Boost.Filesystem

Boost.Serialization

Boost.Asio

OpenSSL: Install OpenSSL development libraries.

Git: To clone the repository.

Build Instructions

Clone the Repository:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
git clone https://github.com/thehorizonholding/HorizCoin.git
cd HorizCoin

Create a Build Directory:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
mkdir build
cd build

Configure the Build:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
cmake ..

Build the Project:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
make

Run a Node:

After building, you can run a HorizCoin node using the executable in the build directory. The exact command-line arguments will depend on your desired configuration (e.g., network settings, data directory). Example:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
./horizcoin --data-dir=/path/to/data

Important Notes and Recommendations:

License: Seriously, add a license file. This is crucial for open-source projects.

Documentation: Prioritize documentation. Without it, it will be very difficult for others to understand, use, and contribute to the project.

Testing: Expand the unit tests to cover more of the codebase.

Security Audits: Consider a security audit by a reputable firm to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Community Building: Actively engage with the community and encourage contributions.

Website/Explorer: A block explorer and project website would be very beneficial.
