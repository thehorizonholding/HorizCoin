📡 HorizCoin – Ultra+Infinity GIC

Global Internet Currency Protocol (GIC)

Universal Monetization Layer for Compute, Bandwidth, Data, IoT, AI, and Global Connectivity

HorizCoin is a next-generation decentralized economic protocol that transforms the entire usable surface of the global internet—including compute, bandwidth, storage, IoT, AI agents, cloud workloads, VPN, fiber optics, Starlink, Amazon infrastructure emulation (Leo), and more—into a unified earning and settlement network.

HorizCoin introduces the world’s first GIC: Global Internet Currency, a universal settlement token designed for cross-infrastructure monetization.

This Ultra+Infinity version expands the project to cover nearly every monetizable resource on the internet.

🚀 Vision

HorizCoin’s mission is to build a global monetary layer for internet activity, allowing anyone—from a laptop user to a global datacenter—to earn currency from:

Compute

Bandwidth

Storage

Network activity

Online attention

Device sensing

IoT communication

AI agent workflows

Edge networks

Global connectivity (fiber, 5G, Starlink)

Privacy networks (VPN)

Cloud platforms

And future digital ecosystems


HorizCoin aims to redefine the internet as a fully monetizable asset, turning participation into income.

🧠 Core Architecture

HorizCoin consists of five primary layers:


---

1️⃣ Blockchain Layer (HORIZ Token + PoB + GIC Engine)

✦ HORIZ Token (Utility Token)

Payments inside the system

Job settlement

Node rewards

Governance (optional)


✦ GIC (Global Internet Currency)

High-speed settlement token

Designed for global micro-transactions

Used by AI agents, IoT devices, and M2M payment flows


✦ PoB (Proof-of-Bandwidth + Proof-of-Connectivity)

Nodes earn rewards by providing verified:

GPU/CPU compute

Network throughput

Storage

Real-time connectivity (including 5G, Starlink)



---

2️⃣ AI Revenue Maximization Layer

HorizCoin uses a dual RL-agent system:

🟣 Agent 1 – Dynamic Pricing (RL)

Optimizes revenue by adjusting:

Compute prices

Bandwidth prices

AI inference/training prices

Network load pricing


🔵 Agent 2 – Allocation & Efficiency (RL)

Optimizes:

GPU distribution

Cloud workload placement

Bandwidth routing

Storage placement


This creates a self-optimizing economic engine.


---

3️⃣ DePIN Layer (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)

HorizCoin aggregates real-world infrastructure:

GPUs

CPUs

5G modems

Routers

Fiber-optic nodes

Starlink terminals

VPN exit nodes

IoT hardware

Datacenter racks


Anyone can contribute resources to earn HorizCoin.


---

4️⃣ Global Connectivity Monetization Layer

This Ultra+Infinity version adds full connectivity monetization, including:

✔ VPN Monetization

Nodes offering bandwidth for secure routing earn tokens.

✔ Fiber Optic Monetization

Nodes with fiber-level throughput receive higher-tier PoB rewards.

✔ Starlink / Satellite

Starlink, SES, OneWeb, and other satellite-based bandwidth can be monetized.

✔ Amazon "Leo" (Cloud Edge Simulation)

When Amazon’s Leo infrastructure launches, its bandwidth + compute pathways become monetizable in HorizCoin using the global connectivity abstraction layer.


---

5️⃣ Universal Monetization Engine (UME)

HorizCoin attempts to capture up to 80%+ of all global internet monetizable surfaces, including:

Category	Examples

Compute	GPUs, CPUs, AI inference
Bandwidth	VPN, routers, fiber, satellite
Storage	IPFS, S3-style buckets
Devices	IoT sensors, edge hardware
Attention	micro-interaction monetization
AI Agents	autonomous earning workflows
Data	training datasets, analytics
Cloud	offloaded workloads


The network aims to become the unified revenue layer for digital infrastructure.


---

💰 Tokenomics (Ultra+Infinity)

Total Supply

1,000,000,000 HORIZ (fixed)


Distribution

50% PoB rewards

20% Community / Ecosystem

20% Team (locked/vested)

10% Liquidity


Economic Flywheel

1. Nodes perform work


2. Clients pay in GIC or stablecoin


3. Protocol buys HORIZ → burns or redistributes


4. Token becomes deflationary with usage


5. Demand rises as more internet surfaces monetized

🌍 Does HorizCoin Work in the Real World?

Yes—HorizCoin is designed to be real-world deployable:

It uses standard blockchain tooling (Solidity, Hardhat)

Bandwidth measurement uses real networking

AI agents run on local compute

Works on macOS, Windows, Linux

Can be hosted on cloud or local machines


Some parts (e.g., Starlink integration, Amazon Leo future integration, regulatory-compliant payment systems) require future real-world partnerships, but the architecture allows them to plug in when available.
