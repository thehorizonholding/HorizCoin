# 🌐 Horiz Project — AI-Powered Multi-Cloud Orchestrator

## Overview

**Horiz** is a private, modular cloud orchestration system designed to manage distributed compute, analytics, and blockchain-based resource optimization.  
It combines **multi-cloud management**, **AI automation**, and **secure data coordination** into one unified platform.

This project integrates:

- 🌩️ **Multi-Cloud Integration** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, etc.)
- 🤖 **AI Orchestrator** — controls 98% of system actions, coordinates deployments, validates data, and self-optimizes
- 🧠 **Analytics Engine** — real-time resource tracking, yield prediction, and performance scoring
- 🔐 **Quantum-Grade Security Layer** — modular cryptographic protection for communication and data
- 🧩 **Private Sharing Module** — optional component for secure, private collaboration between services
- ⚙️ **Revenue Optimizer** — dynamic system to maximize compute value while maintaining balance between cost and performance

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development Mode)

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker (optional)
- GitHub account with repository access

### 2️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/horiz.git
cd horiz

3️⃣ Set up the backend

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Launch the orchestrator in simulation mode

python ai_orchestrator/planner.py --goal "initialize cloud connectors"
python ai_orchestrator/executor.py --plan-file plan.json --dry

5️⃣ Start the dashboard UI

cd ui
npm install
npm run dev

Then visit http://localhost:3000

☁️ Cloud Integration

Each connector in ai_orchestrator/connectors/ can be configured independently:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=yourkey
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yoursecret
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/gcp.json
export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY=yourkey
export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY=yoursecret

The orchestrator automatically detects available credentials and links active servers across providers.


---

🔐 Security & Privacy

Privacy Guard: All sensitive computations and credentials are sandboxed locally.

Quantum Security Layer: Designed for future integration with PQC libraries (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium).

Private AI Control: All orchestration logic can run in fully offline/private environments.



---

🧠 AI Capabilities

The AI orchestrator:

Coordinates resource deployment and scaling across multiple clouds

Analyzes cost, performance, and latency metrics

Suggests and executes optimization plans

Learns from prior executions and updates configurations autonomously

Supports integration with GPT, external APIs, and analytics services



---

📈 Optimization Modules

Module	Description

revenue_optimizer.py	Calculates potential yield per cloud and rebalances workloads
analytics_engine.py	Tracks usage metrics, predicts future demand
privacy_guard.py	Enforces privacy compliance and local-only data retention
multi_cloud_sync.py	Ensures consistent replication and data coordination



---

⚙️ Deployment (Optional)

You can containerize the project:

docker build -t horiz-ai .
docker run -p 8080:8080 horiz-ai

Or deploy using GitHub Actions + cloud pipelines (ECS, GKE, or Aliyun Function Compute).
